Java program that simulates Single Lane Bridge problem.
 
Defition (from https://orajavasolutions.wordpress.com/2014/05/03/single-lane-bridge-problem)
Problem : A single-lane bridge connects the two Vermont villages of North Tunbridge and South Tunbridge. 
Farmers in the two villages use this bridge to deliver their produce to the neighboring town. 
The bridge can become deadlocked if both a northbound and a southbound farmer get on the bridge at the same time (
Vermont farmers are stubborn and are unable to back up.) 
Using semaphores, design an algorithm that prevents deadlock.
